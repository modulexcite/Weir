Notes (vaguely ordered):

 - UX
  * make all buttons bigger on mobile
  * add "open current in new tab" button on mobile
  * add close button to hide activated items
  * Allow non-activation of top item, keyboard shouldn't freak out.
  * Add 3D transformations to make things interesting once Angular.animate lands in stable
  
 - Add OPML export, now that I've got my feed list down

 - DisplayStack improvements
  * DisplayStack.dialog(), DisplayStack.confirm()

 - Feed management improvements
  * Enable sorting of feeds by result, name, tag (eventually)
  * Add current story count to feeds, display

 - Logging:
  * Add different log levels and tagging
  * Feed log to file in addition to stdOut (allows running as job)

 - Remove CSS compilation from the Server, consider other handlers

 - Add ability to write server cfg.json with .save();

 - Weir.Sanitize improvements
  * Add rudimentary ad/social blocking

 - Add to options service
  * key map - character/code to verb, then teach Stream to understand those
  * list length
  * buttons on sidebar

 - Configure router to support REST params
 
 - Add SQLite support
